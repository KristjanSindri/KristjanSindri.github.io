    From their cables, ANAKIN and OBI-WAN both spot something that causes them to stop fighting. The lava river ahead drops off in a tremendous lava fall.
    SNAPPING AND METAL GROANS are heard as the main part of the collector starts to break away and move toward the lava fall. OBI-WAN looks around and sees a small floating platform making its way toward the tower.
    OBI-WAN does a double hack-flip and lands squarely on the floating platform. He immediately leans to one side and moves away from the tower.
    OBI-WAN and ANAKIN continue the swordfight. They battle away, balancing on the tiny platform and puzzled DROID. ANAKIN, standing on the Droid, approaches OBI-WAN on the work platform.
    OBI-WAN: I have failed you, Anakin. I was never able to teach you to think.
    ANAKIN and OBI-WAN confront each other on the lava river.
    ANAKIN: I should have known the Jedi were plotting to take over . . .
    OBI-WAN: From the Sith!!! Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil.
    ANAKIN: From the Jedi point of view! From my point of view, the Jedi are evil.
    OBI-WAN: Well, then you are lost!
    ANAKIN: This is the end for you, My Master. I wish it were otherwise.
    ANAKIN jumps and flips onto OBI- WAN's platform. The fighting continues again until OBI-WAN jumps toward the safety of the black sandy edge of the lava river. He yells at Anakin.
    OBI-WAN: It's over, Anakin. I have the high ground.
    ANAKIN: You underestimate my power!
    OBI-WAN: Don't try it.
    ANAKIN follows, and OBI-WAN cuts his young apprentice at the knees, then cuts off his left arm in the blink of an eye. ANAKIN tumbles down the embankment and rolls to a stop near the edge of the lava.
    ANAKIN struggles to pull himself up the embankment with his mechanical hand. His thin leather glove has been burned off. He keeps sliding down in the black sand.
    OBI-WAN: (continuing) . . . You were the Chosen One! It was said that you would, destroy the Sith, not join them. It was you who would bring balance to the Force, not leave it in Darkness.
    OBI-WAN picks up Anakin's light saber and begins to walk away. He stops and looks back.
    ANAKIN: I hate you!
    OBI-WAN: You were my brother, Anakin. I loved you.
    ANAKIN'S clothing blows into the lava river and ignites. Suddenly ANAKIN bursts into flames and starts SCREAMING.
    215 INT. MUSTAFAR-VOLCANO EDGE-DAY
    OBI-WAN looks in horror as ANAKIN becomes engulfed in flames. OBI-WAN can't watch him as he struggles to climb the embankment, covered in flames.
    He runs back to Padme's ship as ANAKIN drops, smoldering, near the top of the lava pit.
